# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Building a webpage for the prework study guide

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I was motivated from the very start of this project to see how much I actually knew about HTML, CSS, and JS and learn how to use Git-Bash and use GitHub to build a repo, and update files, how to branch, and use version control.
- I did this project to combine everything I have learned over the last 6 months and apply to a real world problem. 
- How to update files using Git-Bash and GitHub to develope a final deployable product of the project.
- By doing this I was able to solve the problem on how to combine HTML, CSS, and JS into a working Webpage. I did this by using Git-Bash and GitHub to effectivley and efficently update files properly with a current versions, while maintaining previous versions in case a bug comes up.

## Usage

This project provides a webpage of my notes for the Prework Study Guide. My notes are broken down into sections, covering some of what I previously knew, and some of what I have learned about HTML, CSS, git, and JS. Once you open the webpage, and you open the DevTools console you can see the JavaScript code running. I will include an image from time to time as this project grows. I would add an image to this README file right now, but this project is still in its infancy.
